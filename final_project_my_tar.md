my_tar
======

The goal of this project is to implement the command **tar** in C++ only using
the standard library.

You can create as many files as you want and you can structure the way you like.

## repository

Your repository will be called **final_project** and should be hosted on my
server.

## tool chain

* make
* g++

## build

Your program will have to be built with **make**, but if no files are changed,
then you need to display:

```
up-to-date
```

## binary

Your **Makefile** will have to generate a binary called **my_tar**.

## requirements

Your program will have to implement the following flags

```
-A, --catenate, --concatenate
    Append  archive to the end of another archive.  The arguments are treated
    as the names of archives to append. All archives must be of the same format
    as the archive they are appended to, otherwise the resulting archive might
    be  unusable with non-GNU implementations of tar. Notice also that when
    more than one archive is given, the members from archives other than the
    first one will be accessible in the resulting archive only if using the -i
    (--ignore-zeros) option.

    Compressed archives cannot be concatenated.

-c, --create
    Create a new archive. Arguments supply the names of the files to be
    archived. Directories are archived recursively, unless the --no-recursion
    option is given.

-d, --diff, --compare
    Find differences between archive and file system. The arguments are
    optional and specify archive members to compare. If not given, the current
    working directory is assumed.

--delete
    Delete from the archive.  The arguments supply names of the archive members
    to be removed. At least one argument must be given.

    This option does not operate on compressed archives. There is no short
    option equivalent.

-r, --append
    Append files to the end of an archive. Arguments have the same meaning as
    for -c (--create).

-t, --list
    List the contents of an archive. Arguments are optional. When given, they
    specify the names of the members to list.

--test-label
    Test the archive volume label and exit. When used without arguments, it
    prints the volume label (if any) and exits with status 0. When one or more
    command line arguments are given.  tar compares the volume label with each
    argument. It  exits  with code 0 if a match is found, and with code 1
    otherwise. No output is displayed, unless used together with the -v
    (--verbose) option.

    There is no short option equivalent for this option.

-u, --update
    Append files which are newer than the corresponding copy in the archive.
    Arguments have the same meaning as with -c and -r options.

-x, --extract, --get
    Extract files from an archive. Arguments are optional. When given, they
    specify names of the archive members to be extracted.

--show-defaults
    Show built-in defaults for various tar options and exit. No arguments are
    allowed.

-?, --help
    Display a short option summary and exit. No arguments allowed.

--usage
    Display a list of available options and exit. No arguments allowed.

--version
    Print program version and copyright information and exit.

-j, --bzip2
    Filter the archive through bzip2(1).

-z, --gzip, --gunzip, --ungzip
    Filter the archive through gzip(1).
```

## example

```
tar -cvf a.tar /etc
or
tar -c -v -f a.tar /etc
```


## implementation

* Your program will have to be able to extract tarballs generated by the
command **tar**
* Your program should be able to create tarballs that can be opened by **tar**


## presentation

The whole group will have to understand each other's code and should be able to
understand it's logic.
If the whole team is not able to explain how some piece of the project are
working, then each team member will see his personal score divided by 2.

## cheat

```
"Cheating seems to be a relevant term only when one is caught in the act.
Otherwise it is viewed as intelligence, no?"
    â€” HK-47, Knights of the Old Republic
```

If a single team member has cheated, the presentation is immediately stopped and
you will ALL be assigned the score **0/100**.
